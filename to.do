(Comprehensive Function Ontology - a free Master Control Program-like system)

(can use etags function indexer to bootstrap things, also look at
 other static analysis techniques.  use NLU/KBFS/UniversalParser
 etc to map out the source code and relations between source files
 and their contents.)

(borrow from eurisko some of the slots, etc)
